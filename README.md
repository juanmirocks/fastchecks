# Features

**üöÄ Speed**
* All operations are asynchronous. This app sits on 3 giants:
  * aiohttp
  * psycopg (v3)
  * APScheduler (v4)
* Speedy regex checking thanks to [google-re2 regex](https://github.com/google/re2). Note that [google-re2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) is very similar to python's native `re` but not equal. In particular, backreferences are not supported, to gain on speed and [safety](https://snyk.io/blog/redos-and-catastrophic-backtracking/).
* Code is fully [type-annotated](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html).


üßò **Safety**
* Binary or too big responses will not be read.
* Safe regex thanks to [google-re2 regex](https://github.com/google/re2).
* Security static analysis with [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) and [snyk](https://snyk.io).
* Further static analysis with mypy & pyflakes.
* Safe escaping of SQL queries with [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/advanced/typing.html#checking-literal-strings-in-queries).
